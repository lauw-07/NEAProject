<!--WHAT I NEED TO IMPLEMENT
    1. Parameters that get passed between one component to other related components 
    (i.e. when choosing a type of instrument in the Topbar component, it will need to notify the Graph component which instrument type is being used)

    2. Allow users to choose instrument type, indicators and more

    3. When inputs are made, the inputs need to be registered. 
    (i.e. for customising the graph, this essentially connects to the API to load more data)
    (i.e. when a specific indicator is chosen, it needs to be graphed for whatever is currently showing in the graph component)

    4. Only access and store data about the stock price data loaded from the api - don't need to expand project to encompass other instruments right now. 

    5. For the instruments that i am not dealing with, i need to create some popup notification that will show whenever one of these instruments are selected
